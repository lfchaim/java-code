/*
In this problem, we are simulating a carpool scenario. 
A car has a certain number of empty seats (given by capacity), and it can only drive in one directionâ€”east. 
We are provided with an array trips, where each element is a trip described by three integers: numPassengers, from, and to. 
These respectively represent the number of passengers for that trip, the kilometer mark where the passengers will be picked up, 
and the kilometer mark where they will be dropped off. Our task is to determine if the car can successfully complete all the 
given trips without ever exceeding its seating capacity. If it is possible to pick up and drop off all passengers for all the 
trips without going over capacity at any point, we return true. Otherwise, we return false.
