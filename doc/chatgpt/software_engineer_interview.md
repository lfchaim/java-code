# For each question do you have the examples Java code?

Certainly! Here are example Java implementations for each of the questions:
1. Two Sum

java

import java.util.HashMap;

public class TwoSum {
    public static int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int complement = target - nums[i];
            if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
                return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
            }
            map.put(nums[i], i);
        }
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("No two sum solution");
    }
}

2. Anagram Check

java

import java.util.Arrays;

public class AnagramChecker {
    public static boolean areAnagrams(String s1, String s2) {
        if (s1.length() != s2.length()) return false;
        char[] charArray1 = s1.toCharArray();
        char[] charArray2 = s2.toCharArray();
        Arrays.sort(charArray1);
        Arrays.sort(charArray2);
        return Arrays.equals(charArray1, charArray2);
    }
}

3. House Robber

java

public class HouseRobber {
    public static int rob(int[] nums) {
        int rob1 = 0, rob2 = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            int temp = Math.max(rob1 + num, rob2);
            rob1 = rob2;
            rob2 = temp;
        }
        return rob2;
    }
}

4. Inorder Traversal (Iterative)

java

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Stack;

public class BinaryTree {
    static class TreeNode {
        int val;
        TreeNode left;
        TreeNode right;
        TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
    }

    public List<Integer> inorderTraversal(TreeNode root) {
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        Stack<TreeNode> stack = new Stack<>();
        TreeNode current = root;

        while (current != null || !stack.isEmpty()) {
            while (current != null) {
                stack.push(current);
                current = current.left;
            }
            current = stack.pop();
            result.add(current.val);
            current = current.right;
        }
        return result;
    }
}

5. Breadth-First Search (BFS)

java

import java.util.*;

public class Graph {
    private Map<Integer, List<Integer>> adjList;

    public Graph() {
        adjList = new HashMap<>();
    }

    public void addEdge(int v, int w) {
        adjList.putIfAbsent(v, new ArrayList<>());
        adjList.get(v).add(w);
    }

    public void bfs(int start) {
        Set<Integer> visited = new HashSet<>();
        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        visited.add(start);
        queue.add(start);

        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int vertex = queue.poll();
            System.out.print(vertex + " ");
            for (int neighbor : adjList.getOrDefault(vertex, new ArrayList<>())) {
                if (!visited.contains(neighbor)) {
                    visited.add(neighbor);
                    queue.add(neighbor);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

6. Quicksort

java

public class QuickSort {
    public static void quickSort(int[] arr, int low, int high) {
        if (low < high) {
            int pivotIndex = partition(arr, low, high);
            quickSort(arr, low, pivotIndex - 1);
            quickSort(arr, pivotIndex + 1, high);
        }
    }

    private static int partition(int[] arr, int low, int high) {
        int pivot = arr[high];
        int i = low - 1;
        for (int j = low; j < high; j++) {
            if (arr[j] < pivot) {
                i++;
                swap(arr, i, j);
            }
        }
        swap(arr, i + 1, high);
        return i + 1;
    }

    private static void swap(int[] arr, int i, int j) {
        int temp = arr[i];
        arr[i] = arr[j];
        arr[j] = temp;
    }
}

7. URL Shortening Service (Design Overview)

This is a design question and does not have a straightforward code example, but a simple implementation of generating a short URL could look like this:

java

import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Random;

public class URLShortener {
    private HashMap<String, String> urlMap = new HashMap<>();
    private Random random = new Random();
    private final String BASE_URL = "http://short.url/";

    public String shortenURL(String longURL) {
        String shortURL = BASE_URL + Integer.toString(random.nextInt(100000), 36);
        urlMap.put(shortURL, longURL);
        return shortURL;
    }

    public String retrieveURL(String shortURL) {
        return urlMap.get(shortURL);
    }
}

8. Thread-Safe Singleton

java

public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {}

    public static synchronized Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}

9. Behavioral Questions

No code example here, but you can structure your response using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result).
10. CAP Theorem Explanation

This question is more theoretical and doesn't have code. You could explain it as follows:

CAP Theorem:

    Consistency: Every read receives the most recent write.
    Availability: Every request receives a response, regardless of success or failure.
    Partition Tolerance: The system continues to operate despite arbitrary partitioning due to network failures.

In practice, you can have only two of the three guarantees in a distributed system.

Feel free to ask if you want more details on any specific topic!
