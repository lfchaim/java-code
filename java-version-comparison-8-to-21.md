## Key Highlights of Evolution

1. **Language Modernization**: 
   - Java has become more concise and expressive with features like lambda expressions, pattern matching, records, and sealed classes.
   - The introduction of `var` and type inference has made code more readable.

2. **Performance Improvements**:
   - Significant focus on reducing memory footprint and improving garbage collection.
   - Introduction of Virtual Threads in recent versions for lightweight concurrency.

3. **Modular Architecture**:
   - Java Platform Module System (JPMS) introduced to improve application design and security.

4. **Enhanced APIs**:
   - Continuous improvement of standard libraries.
   - Introduction of modern APIs for HTTP clients, process handling, and concurrency.

5. **Developer Productivity**:
   - JShell REPL for interactive coding.
   - Improved error messages and diagnostics.
   - More powerful standard libraries reducing boilerplate code.

## Recommended Migration Path

- Start from Java 8
- Migrate to Java 11 (Long-Term Support)
- Consider Java 17 or Java 21 for the latest features
- Use tools like `jdeps` to check module and dependency compatibility
- Gradually adopt new language features
- Leverage new performance improvements

**Note**: While Java has added numerous features, it maintains strong backward compatibility, allowing gradual adoption of new capabilities.
